## This project is designed to be focused on measurable factors, such as interest rates, inflation, job postings, ppi for tech, etc. where each factor is denoted a weight based on their significance. The ultimate unit of that will be calculated will be an economic indication number, the higher the number, the more likely it is that tech jobs will be a coveted commodity.
